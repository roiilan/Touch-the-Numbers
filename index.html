<!-- 
â€¢ User sees a board with 16 cells, containing numbers 1..16, in a random order
o Hint: use an HTML table
o Hint: Nice technique for building the board:
place the 16 numbers in a simple array, shuffle it, then build the <table> by
popping a number from the nums array.
o Note: there is no need to use as matrix in this exercise -->
